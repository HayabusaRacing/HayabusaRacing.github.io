        <h1>Summary of the Simulation</h1>
        <p>
            We used a combination of Newton's Second Law of motion and the quadratic drag force to model the velocity of the car as a function of time. The model only accounts for two forces: Constant thrust from the CO2 cartridge and quadratic air drag.
            \[F_{drag} = \frac{1}{2} \rho C_d A v^2 = k v^2\]
            \[F_{total} = m a = F_{thrust} - F_{drag}\]
            \[a = \frac{F_{total}}{m}\]
            \[\frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{F_{thrust} - kv^2}{m}\]
            This separable differential equation could be solved analytically, and turns out to form a tangent hyperbolic equation. On this page, we used the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method to numerically solve the differential equation and plot the velocity versus time graph.
        </p>
        <p>
            We assumed that the affecting factors of the car's lap times are listed below:
            <ul>
                <li>Mass of the car</li>
                <li>Aerodynamic drag</li>
                <li>Aerodynamic lift</li>
                <li>Thrust from the CO2 cartridge</li>
                <li>Bearing friction</li>
                <li>Wheel inertia</li>
                <li>Cartridge-caused tipping moment</li>
            </ul>
            The following forces will be modeled as a function of time:
            \[F_{thrust}(t) \text{: the force created by the cartridge thrust}\]
            \[F_{drag}(t) \text{: the force created by aerodynamic drag}\]
            \[F_{lift}(t) \text{: the force created by aerodynamic lift}\]
            \[F_{friction}(t) \text{: the force created by bearing friction}\]
            In addition, the mass of the car is expected to alter with respect to time, as the cartridge is used up; thus, we will model the mass as a function of time:
            \[m(t) \text{: the mass of the car at time } t\]
            A single wheel's inertia could be considered as a virtual mass and will be a constant value.
            \[I_{fw} \text{: the front wheel's inertia}\]
            \[I_{rw} \text{: the rear wheel's inertia}\]
            The tipping moment caused by the cartridge directly reduces the efficiency of the thrust, and will be a constant value.
            \[\eta_{tip} \text{: the tipping moment efficiency factor}\]
            Now, when we combine all these forces, we can write the equation of the force applied to the car.
            \[F_{total}(t) = F_{thrust}(t) \cdot \eta_{tip} - F_{drag}(t) - F_{friction}(t)\]
            According to Newton's Second Law, the derivative of the velocity is proportional to the total force applied to the car, divided by the mass of the car.
            \[F=ma\]
            \[a=\frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{F_{total}(t)}{m(t)}\ = \frac{F_{thrust}(t) \cdot \eta_{tip} - F_{drag}(t) - F_{friction}(t)}{m(t)}\]
