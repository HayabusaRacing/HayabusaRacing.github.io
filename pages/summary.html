        <h1>Summary of the Simulation</h1>
        <p>
            We used a combination of Newton's Second Law of motion and the quadratic drag force to model the velocity of the car as a function of time. The model only accounts for two forces: Constant thrust from the CO2 cartridge and quadratic air drag.
            \[F_{drag} = \frac{1}{2} \rho C_d A v^2 = k v^2\]
            \[F_{total} = m a = F_{thrust} - F_{drag}\]
            \[a = \frac{F_{total}}{m}\]
            \[\frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{F_{thrust} - kv^2}{m}\]
            This separable differential equation could be solved analytically, and turns out to form a tangent hyperbolic equation. On this page, we used the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method to numerically solve the differential equation and plot the velocity versus time graph.
        </p>
        <p>
            We assumed that the affecting factors of the car's lap times are listed below:
            <ul>
                <li>Mass of the car</li>
                <li>Aerodynamic drag</li>
                <li>Aerodynamic lift</li>
                <li>Thrust from the CO2 cartridge</li>
                <li>Bearing friction</li>
                <li>Rolling resistance</li>
                <li>Wheel inertia</li>
                <li>Cartridge-caused tipping moment</li>
                <li>Aerodynamically-caused tipping moment</li>
            </ul>
            The following following forces will be scribed as a function of time:
            \[F_{thrust}(t) \text{: the force created by the cartridge thrust}\]
            \[F_{drag}(t) \text{: the force created by aerodynamic drag}\]
            \[F_{lift}(t) \text{: the force created by aerodynamic lift}\]
            \[F_{friction}(t) \text{: the force created by bearing friction}\]
            \[F_{rolling}(t) \text{: the force created by rolling resistance}\]
            In addition, the mass is expected to alter with respect to time, as the cartridge is used up, thus, we will scribe the mass as a function of time:
            \[m(t) \text{: the mass of the car at time } t\]
